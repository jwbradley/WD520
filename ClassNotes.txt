AngularJS-- We continue to see JavaScript frameworks as a useful way to structure code and bring better 
coding techniques to JavaScript. AngularJS is used widely by ThoughtWorks projects. However we do advise 
teams to assess other good alternatives such as Ember.js and Knockout.js.

Dependency management for JavaScript
Using Dependency management tools for JavaScript has helped our delivery teams handle large amounts of 
JavaScript by structuring their code and loading the dependencies at runtime. Though this simplified 
the effort in most cases, lazy loading complicates supporting offline mode. Different dependency 
management tools have different strengths, so choose based on your context.

Ansible
Since first featuring Ansible in the last radar, we continue to be impressed with its capabilities and 
ease of use compared to other offerings in this space. Based on our experiences over the last year we 
have no hesitation in recommending Ansible as a great option for automated control of your infrastructure.


Java 8 new *****
The team behind Java 8 had to fight two battles: the community forces encouraging forever backwards 
compatibility (a long hallmark of Java) and the technical challenge of making a deep language change 
mesh with existing libraries and features. They succeeded on both fronts, breathing new life into the 
Java Language and placing it on par with other mainstream languages in terms of functional programming 
features. In particular, Java 8 has excellent syntactic magic that allows seamless interoperability 
between Lambda blocks, the new higher-order function feature, and SAM (Single Abstract Method) 
interfaces, the traditional way of passing behavior.



http://lesscss.org/
Less is a CSS pre-processor, meaning that it extends the CSS language, adding features that allow 
variables, mixins, functions and many other techniques that allow you to make CSS that is more 
maintainable, themable and extendable.

Less runs inside Node, in the browser and inside Rhino. There are also many 3rd party tools that 
allow you to compile your files and watch for changes.

Become a Social Developer!
http://getinvolved.hanselman.com/
In this feature-length production, Scott Hanselman and Rob Conery offer suggestions and advice on 
how you can get out there, and get involved. Blogging, Twitter, Github, StackOverflow, User Groups 
and Conferences: all of this can make you a happier, more productive developer and inspire you to 
take your career to the next level.

You certainly don't have to be social to be better at writing code - but sharpening your skills 
this way helps you when it comes time for a job interview, a yearly review where a promotion is 
on the line, or when you want to start running an Open Source project.

http://coffeescript.org/
CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. Underneath that awkward Java-esque patina, JavaScript has always had a gorgeous heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.

The golden rule of CoffeeScript is: "It's just JavaScript". The code compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no interpretation at runtime. You can use any existing JavaScript library seamlessly from CoffeeScript (and vice-versa). The compiled output is readable and pretty-printed, will work in every JavaScript runtime, and tends to run as fast or faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.

http://bower.io/
Web sites are made of lots of things — frameworks, libraries, assets, utilities, and rainbows. Bower manages all these things for you.

Bower works by fetching and installing packages from all over, taking care of hunting, finding, downloading, and saving the stuff you’re looking for. Bower keeps track of these packages in a manifest file, bower.json. How you use packages is up to you. Bower provides hooks to facilitate using packages in your tools and workflows.

This repository is meant to provide an example for forking a repository on GitHub.

Creating a fork is producing a personal copy of someone else's project. Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy. You can submit Pull Requests to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project. Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.

http://www.commonjs.org/
http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS
JavaScript is a powerful object oriented language with some of the fastest dynamic language interpreters around. The official JavaScript specification defines APIs for some objects that are useful for building browser-based applications. However, the spec does not define a standard library that is useful for building a broader range of applications.
The CommonJS API will fill that gap by defining APIs that handle many common application needs, ultimately providing a standard library as rich as those of Python, Ruby and Java. The intention is that an application developer will be able to write an application using the CommonJS APIs and then run that application across different JavaScript interpreters and host environments.
